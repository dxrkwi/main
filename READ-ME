This Site is made for a Discord Bot called GemCaculator#2420.
You can find the ToS and Privacy Policy in this Directory aswell.

If you want further Information about the Project continue Reading this:

The Bot was made for the purpose of Caculating Gems for my Guild in EU8. I've made a Excelsheet before with the Information but Discord Bots seem more fun. Why not share it?
this bot will run until my free Server will run out. If this Bot receives positiv feedback(donations for maintain) or I'm still playing at this point it will continue running. The free Server will Run out ~2years from now so according to that the Date shall be
ca. 15.10.2025!

I'm a German Student with a bit of Programming Know-How even tho I'm studying Cybersecurity.

Some Data about the Bot:

Its written in Python (who would've guessed?(I use C++ for Uni but it would've been a pain to write this in C++))
The Code took me around 1 Hour and Setting the Sync up so the Bot doesnt Output the same stuff 3 Times after Typing !c took me 6Hours (bug fixes are fun)

Well yeah thats about it. Have fun using the Bot :)
